description: There has been a lot of debate among historians about which explorers
  were actually the first to reach the North Pole. What if a pair of plucky youths
  bore that honor? That's the premise behind Edward Stratemeyer's action-adventure
  classic, First at the North Pole. Fans of golden-era juvenile fiction will relish
  this rollicking tale.
